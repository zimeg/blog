last ride to the office ended a block earlier than usual with blood out the
nose.

a green hill made me fast while a right turning car waited for strollers to
cross.

belief in safe passage was hoped as i continued on but the car went.

bells in a construction zone went unheard and distance closed quick.

earlier speed on a weighted bike was not stopped with weak brakes.

collision instead ended the trip.
