the fence surrounding a hole in the ground filled with rain the past few months
was painted black and white.

a notice is taped in blue to state a violation of the "public works code" and
"article 23" is cited.

across the street towards the end the place next to the parking lot still had
painted words across the windows.

some of it was gone when i got home.

the parking lot next door still had painted walls.

behind the busted entrance to the building that i live i looked through the
door.
