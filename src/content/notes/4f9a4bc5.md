earlier this month i cheered for my home team as the dallas mavericks played
against the golden state warriors.

either outcome would have been celebrated but i am glad the warriors won.
playoff standings were questionable.

recent interest in the game was found with renewed reverence for the great kobe
bryant.

the [mamba mentality][kobe] inspires excellence and consistent excellence in the
game awes.

getting buckets is great too.
