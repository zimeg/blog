one two or three fours made halved to six. in moduli the other evens and even
nine appear.

forgone are primes!

those numbers need to be counted still.

notes in a chromatic scale depend on it. months in the calendar too. degrees of
a circle find other division. a hand with creased knuckles counts on this basis.

realizations from other example are left as an exercise to the reader.
