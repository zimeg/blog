earlier this week i knocked my laptop off whatever perch i had picked and onto
the ground.

i try not to do this but that night i failed. i even said a bad word!

quick observation showed an unharmed screen and relieved big worry.

resuming my online activities revealed new worries: an unresponsive trackpad and
keyboard.

[thankfully others have encountered this before and offer solution][yt].

thinking experience with software translated to hardware tinkering was foolish.
but i started stripping screws and bending covers anyways.

hours spent "fixing" has since brought frustration and disappointment. some at
the difficulty of repair though most at the timing of events.

this laptop lasted a healthy six years as my primary machine with only an
occasional problem.

plans for a new laptop have been floating since starting this new year.

hopes for the peaceful retirement feel so distant as i write this with an
external keyboard.
