social medias are curious technologies but posting to other platforms sits
strangely with me.

the fleeting nature of posts and content scattered across services
makes a jumble.

a personal site provides place to showcase ramblings and endeavors.
and writing on a blog has a fun feel to it. so here we are.

## wishful thinkings

predicting the future is hard and this is yet another attempt at a blog. no
promises are made about the type or frequency of content posted. however i hope
to share what i find interesting and to not break links.

### continuous change

even a static site changes. follow the progressions in the
[changelog][changelog] or subscribe to the rss feeds for updates on new
[blog posts][blog].

ocassional messages are sent via email so [join the mailing list][mail] too!
