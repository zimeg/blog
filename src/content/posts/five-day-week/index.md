title: the five day week
description: odd divisions of a year

seven is an odd number. it also isn't a great divisor. yet we choose it when
dividing the days of a year into weeks?

five is also odd, but divides a bit more nicely into the year. quite a bit more
nicely.

## a modest division

shorten weeks to five days. and adjust the current twelve months to have thirty
days each.

days can be called: onesday, twosday, threesday, foursday, fivesday.

for calendar called: quintus.

each month then has six equal weeks. this neglects about five or six days which
trail as a standalone "nil" week.

## calendar

formatting the calendar is somewhat simple and included below for reference.

review [basic comparisons to the traditional gregorian calendar][gregorian]
also.

## ramification of change

smooth social transition into new timekeepings is beyond the scope of this page.

i imagine there would be complications and some things might break.

[instead the immediate benefits shall be touted and concerns quelled!][changes]

## remarks on related readings

finding [alternative measurements][reform] has been considered multiple times.

[exploring every option is left as an exercise for the reader][calendars].
linked are a few brief reflections.

## dated idea

tuesday isn't real. time is only continuous and we build our constructs around
it.

be in this moment.
