finding [alternative measurements][reform] has been considered multiple times.

exploring every option is left as an exercise for the reader. below are a few
brief reflections.

## astronomical observations

[the traditional chinese calendar signaled the solar signs and solstices][chinese]!

lunisolar patterns predicated month lengths and every event followed.

natural sequences are valued but frequent adjustments to account for seasonal
drifts are inconvenient.

## perennial posits

[the international fixed calendar set consistent days to dates each year][cotsworth]!

equal months of 28 days standardizes weekdays. but with 13 months.

five day weeks achieve this anyways and without the unlucky number.

## ten days a week

[the egyptian civil calendar pioneered thirty day months long, long ago][egyptian]!

weeks were metered by ten days forming twelve months which about matched a five
day scheme. though leap years were omitted.

roman reform added leap years but eventually gregorian was adopted. modern
[ethiopian calendars][ethiopian] retain 30 day months albeit 7 day weeks.

truly original innovation shown ahead of its time.

[the temporary french republican calendar placed ten days in the week][french]!

revolutionary removal of royalty and religion requested a new calendar.
decimalization was desired with ten appearing across times and dates.

similar balance between months was achieved with thirty day months and
complementary days trailing.

a shifted start of the year and starting year makes this change drastic. longer
hours in a day makes it unappealing.

## ten months a year

[the legendary calendar of romulus fixed ten months and ignored two][romulus]!

months flipped between 30 and 31 days so a year was only 304 days long. winter
months were left unorganized without farming tasks.

some accounts claim eight day weeks. organization feels forgotten.

[the base ten numbering system is applied to everything in a deciyear][deciyear]!

ten months make a year and have 36 days each - 4 weeks of 9 days.

consistency in months is appreciated but the weeks become so long. subdividing a
year begins to split months too.

millidays make time which simplifies calculations but changes much.
