changing times bring uncertain questions and cause for some reason.

different motivation and common curiosities are addressed but others exist and
are unsolved or unknown.

## following the phases

luna, our wonderful moon, [cycles through a full moon every 29.5 days][moon].

## clocking out

working a job monday through friday totals to 71.429% of week days.

this is close enough to 70% for practical purposes.

scheduling seven days of work across ten days brings opportunity for more
asynchronous collaborations or perhaps more frequent days off without
challenging existing arrangements around hours at a job.

workers routinely grinding from 9-5 regain just one hour over ten days.

## multiplying moduli

constant multiples of five find familiar factors for the months and days.

calculating the day of the week and difference between days becomes elementary.

for example, jul. 24 is a foursday and happens 107 days before nov. 11.

modeling this calendar in code then commands plain arrays instead of specialized
libraries. compatibility with the current notwithstanding.

## coins in quarters

splitting a year into groups of four is customary and encouraged with an
abundant number of weeks (72).

composing 72 might happen with 4 groups of 18, forming 90 day sets. trisections
are also possible using 3 groups of 24, making sets of 120.

coincidentally 7200 minutes make up the 120 hours in a week.

the degree of effective days (360) matches the roundness of a circle.

## observed ceremony

religious practices and cultural events often follow a weekly cadence.

changing the calendar would cause challenge and i cannot propose a solution.
this is merely a thought experiment.
